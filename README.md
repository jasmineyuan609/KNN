KNN Visualizer is an interactive tool designed to help users understand how the k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm works. The tool provides a graphical representation of data points and decision boundaries based on different values of k.

Features

Interactive visualization of the KNN algorithm in action

Adjustable k value to observe classification changes

Ability to add custom data points and modify datasets

Real-time decision boundary updates

Color-coded classification for better understanding

Installation

To use KNN Visualizer locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/KNN-Visualizer.git
cd KNN-Visualizer

Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the application:

python main.py

Usage

Start the application and load a dataset.

Adjust the k value to explore different classification outcomes.

Add new data points and see how the model classifies them.

Observe real-time changes in the decision boundary.

Dependencies

This project requires:

Python 3.x

NumPy

Matplotlib

Scikit-learn

Tkinter (if using a GUI-based visualization)
