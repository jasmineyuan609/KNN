The KNN Visualizer is an interactive tool designed to demonstrate the working principles of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. It allows users to visualize how the algorithm classifies data points based on their nearest neighbors, helping in understanding concepts like decision boundaries and classification in machine learning.

Features

Interactive visualization of KNN classification

Adjustable parameters such as K value, dataset size, and distance metric

Support for different datasets and custom data input

Real-time updates on classification changes

Graphical representation of decision boundaries

Installation

To run the KNN Visualizer locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/KNN-Visualizer.git
cd KNN-Visualizer

Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the application:

python knn_visualizer.py

Usage

Launch the application and select a dataset.

Adjust the K value to see how classification changes.

Add or remove data points interactively.

Choose a distance metric (e.g., Euclidean, Manhattan).

Observe decision boundaries and classifications in real time.

Dependencies

The following libraries are required:

Python 3.x

NumPy

Matplotlib

Scikit-learn

Install them using:

pip install numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
